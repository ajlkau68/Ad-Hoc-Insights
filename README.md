## Business Requests

The analysis provides answers to the following critical business questions using SQL:

1. Provide a list of products with a base price greater than 500 and that are featured in the promo type BOGOF(Buy One Get One Free):
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT(f.product_code), product_name, base_price, promo_type
   FROM fact_events f
   JOIN dim_products d ON d.product_code = f.product_code
   WHERE base_price > 500 and promo_type = 'BOGOF';
   ```

2. Generate a report that provides an overview of the number of stores in each city:
   ```sql
   SELECT city AS City, COUNT(store_id) AS Store_Count 
   FROM dim_stores
   GROUP BY City
   ORDER BY Store_Count DESC;
   ```

3. Generate a report that displays each campaign along with the total revenue generated before and after the campaign:
   ```sql
   SELECT campaign_Name AS Campaign, 
  	CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(base_price * quantity_sold_before_promo)/1000000, 2), ' M') as Revenue_before_promotion,
  	REPLACE(CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(
  		CASE
  			WHEN promo_type = 'BOGOF' THEN ((base_price * 0.5) * quantity_sold_after_promo) * 2
  			WHEN promo_type = '50% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.5) * quantity_sold_after_promo
  			WHEN promo_type = '25% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.75) * quantity_sold_after_promo
  			WHEN promo_type = '33% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.67) * quantity_sold_after_promo
  			WHEN promo_type = '500 Cashback' THEN (base_price - 500) * quantity_sold_after_promo
  		END)/1000000, 2), ' M'), 0, '') AS Revenue_after_promotion
   FROM fact_events f
   JOIN dim_campaigns d ON d.campaign_id = f.campaign_id
   GROUP BY campaign_Name;
   ```

4. Produce a report that calculates the Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU) for each category sold during the Diwali campaign.
Additionally, provide rankings for the categories based on their ISU%:
  ```sql
  WITH category_sale AS(
  SELECT category,
  	ROUND(SUM(
  		CASE
    		WHEN promo_type = 'BOGOF' THEN quantity_sold_after_promo * 2
    		ELSE quantity_sold_after_promo
    		END - quantity_sold_before_promo) * 100 
    		/ SUM(quantity_sold_before_promo), 2) AS ISU_percent
  FROM fact_events f
  JOIN dim_campaigns c ON c.campaign_id = f.campaign_id
  JOIN dim_products p ON p.product_code = f.product_code
  WHERE campaign_Name = 'Diwali'
  GROUP BY category
  )
  SELECT category, ISU_percent,
  	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ISU_percent DESC) AS category_rank
  FROM category_sale;
```
![ISU per Category during Diwali Campaign](https://github.com/ajlkau68/Ad-Hoc-Insights/blob/main/images/query%204.png)

5. Create a report featuring the top 5 products ranked by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%) across all campaigns:
  ```sql
  SELECT TOP 5 product_name, category,
	ROUND(SUM(
		CASE
			WHEN promo_type = 'BOGOF' THEN (base_price * 0.5) * quantity_sold_after_promo * 2
			WHEN promo_type = '50% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.5) * quantity_sold_after_promo
			WHEN promo_type = '25% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.75) * quantity_sold_after_promo
			WHEN promo_type = '33% OFF' THEN (base_price * 0.67) * quantity_sold_after_promo
			WHEN promo_type = '500 Cashback' THEN (base_price - 500) * quantity_sold_after_promo
			ELSE 0
			END 
			- base_price * quantity_sold_before_promo)
			/ SUM(base_price * quantity_sold_before_promo) * 100, 2) AS IR_PCT
  FROM fact_events f
  JOIN dim_products p ON p.product_code = f.product_code
  GROUP BY product_name, category
  ORDER BY IR_PCT DESC;
  ```
